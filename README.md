Revolutionary Online Education/Conference System : New Transfer Protocol Design with AI.

# Goals
 1) AI Based Compressing Method
 2) Efficient Transfer Protocol Design for Video-Conference Systems
In this project, we planned revolutionary innovations in accessibility (smooth and smooth video streaming at low network speeds), which is the main issue of online education.
For this, we aim to use the image compression algorithms, which use the convolutional neural network method, recently published, by implementing neural layers in the most efficient and minimalist way. And we will transfer the images compressed with artificial intelligence, to the transfer protocol that we created according to a video conferencing application. 

# TODO
## Back-End-I (AI Based Compressing)
1) Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks efficiently , without any other package requirements.
2) Design Compress-Decompress Layers for Each Frame : [An End-to-End Compression Framework Based on Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00838v1.pdf)

## Back-End-II (Transfer Protocol for Compressed Frames in Video Conferences)

## Front-End
1) Designing Graphical Interface for Online Education
